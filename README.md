TEAM 7
======


Instructions for team members:
Please document your code.  Use comments liberally to narrate your thinking.

Please do all of your work in the "develop" branch.  We can merge to the master when
we are happy with our work.

Ben's coding style: 
member variables start with "m"
Example mScanner is a Scanner at the class level
scanner is a Scanner scoped inside a method

Curly braces open at the end of the line

Preferred:  

	public void method(){
		

	}
